        Through this project, I attempt to step into the user's shoes and develop
        an in-depth understanding of their experiences using the thermostat in my home.
        In this process, I observe and interview three thermostat users to define
        <span class="bold_large">personas</span> and create
        a <span class="bold_large">storyboard</span> illustrating the
        user's journey using the product.

        This digital thermostat gives residents and visitors of the house the ability
        to view and adjust the temperature. Its digital screen indicates the
        current temperature and the desired. It also indicates if the fan is on
        at any given time. Below the screen, the interface features the
        option to toggle between the home's heating and cooling systems as
        well as the option to turn both systems off. An additional toggle allows
        the user to select if the fan should be on or automatic. Finally, the
        increment and decrement buttons to the right of the screen allow the user
        to increase or decrease the temperature at which the thermostat is set.
