        Through this project, I attempt to step into the user's shoes and develop
        an in-depth understanding of their experiences using the thermostat in my home.
        In this process, I observe and interview three thermostat users to define
        <span class="bold_large">personas</span> and create
        a <span class="bold_large">storyboard</span> illustrating the
        user's journey using the product.

        This digital thermostat gives residents and visitors of the house the ability
        to view and adjust the temperature. Its digital screen indicates the
        current temperature and the desired. It also indicates if the fan is on
        at any given time. Below the screen, the interface features the
        option to toggle between the home's heating and cooling systems as
        well as the option to turn both systems off. An additional toggle allows
        the user to select if the fan should be on or automatic. Finally, the
        increment and decrement buttons to the right of the screen allow the user
        to increase or decrease the temperature at which the thermostat is set.

          <p>User 1:</p>
          <p>Immediately used increment and decrement buttons. Did not use any
            of the other interactive components. Asked if turning the fan off
            completely was an option.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="observations">
          <p>User 2:</p>
          <p>Looked at the interface for about 5 seconds before touching the
            interface. Switched the system to COOL setting. Lowered temperature.
            Waited for a few seconds then lowered the temperature about three
            more degrees. Waited a few more seconds and then nodded when the
            system was audible. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="observations">
          <p>User 3:</p>
          <p>Lowered the desired temperature. Waited for a few seconds then
            moved the fan toggle from "AUTO" to "ON". Lowered the temperature again.
            Looked at me and said "i'm done!" when the fan symbol appeared on the screen.

          I conducted interviews with each of the users to gain insight on their
          motives, expetations, and general experiences using the thermostat.
          The following is a overview of these interviews:

            <p> <strong>User 1:</strong> Oh, wow. A lot I guess. I look at it every time I walk by. Just out of curiousity. </p>
            <p> <strong>User 2:</strong> Maybe two or three times. I only look at it when I feel like its especially cold or warm.</p>
