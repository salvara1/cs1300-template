        Through this project, I attempt to step into the user's shoes and develop
        an in-depth understanding of their experiences using the thermostat in my home.
        In this process, I observe and interview three thermostat users to define
        <span class="bold_large">personas</span> and create
        a <span class="bold_large">storyboard</span> illustrating the
        user's journey using the product.

        This digital thermostat gives residents and visitors of the house the ability
        to view and adjust the temperature. Its digital screen indicates the
        current temperature and the desired. It also indicates if the fan is on
        at any given time. Below the screen, the interface features the
        option to toggle between the home's heating and cooling systems as
        well as the option to turn both systems off. An additional toggle allows
        the user to select if the fan should be on or automatic. Finally, the
        increment and decrement buttons to the right of the screen allow the user
        to increase or decrease the temperature at which the thermostat is set.

      <div class="title"><h2>General Observations</h2></div>
        To better understand how users would interact with this interface, I observed three of my roommates
        use the thermostat's interface. A summary of my general observations can be found below:
        <ul>
          <li>Two users immediately used '+' and '-' buttons and completely avoided changing the system setting</li>
          <li>None of the users adjusted the fan toggle. Some questioned its purpose and how it fit into the entire system</li>
          <li>All three users waited until they could hear the system audibly to stop adjusting the interface</li>
          <li>One user looked at interface closely, adjusted system setting, then adjusted temperature using '+' and '-' buttons</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <!-- interview questions -->
    <div class="section">
      <div class="title"><h2>Interview Questions</h2></div>
      Following each observation, I conducted an interview with the user to gain insight on their
      motives, expectations, and general experiences using the thermostat. Below
      you will find an overview of the interviews with three users
      <ol>
        <li>When and why do you use this interface?</li>
        <ul>
          <li> <b>User 1:</b> I don't user it a lot. I only ever use it if I'm feeling
            so uncomfortably hot or cold that I like wake up or something.
            This is typically in the middle of the night or right when I wake
            up in the morning.
          </li>
          <li><b>User 2: </b> I like to bundle up at night, so I turn it the system off at
            night— unless it’s hot out of course. Other than that, I glance
            at it pretty much every time I walk by it just out of curiosity,
            and if the temperature is uncomfortable in my room, I usually get
            up to change the temp.
          </li>
          <li> <b>User 3: </b> I use it when I'm feeling really cold in the mornings.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>How was your experience using this interface?</li>
        <ul>
          <li> <b>User 1:</b> I usually don't pay attention when I use it. I press the
              up or down buttons until I hear it turn on. Simple.
              The +/- buttons are intuitive and the screen is lit up,
              so there's no confusion about the temperature. </li>
          <li> <b>User 2: </b> Standard. I always get confused by temperatures. I don't know
            if I should turn on the heat or A/C, but the temperature screen helps help.</li>
          <li> <b>User 3: </b> It went well. I did what I needed it to and ignored the rest.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>What challenges did you encounter if any?</li>
        <ul>
          <li> <b>User 1: </b>The "FAN" section threw me off. I don't really know what the fan's
            purpose is in the whole eco-system. There must be a reason why you can't completely turn it off.</li>
          <li> <b>User 2: </b>I had to make sure it was on the right system because
            sometime’s I’ll put the heating system on and then lower the
            temperature instead of turning on the A/C then lowering the temp. I had to make sure I didn't do that.
            Then, I didn’t hear the air turn on, so I had lowered the temp some
            more to help trigger it.</li>
          <li> <b>User 3: </b>The only thing I could see as a challenge was that I didn't understand the purpose
            of the "fan" portion of the thermostat. </li>
        </ul>
      </ol>

          <p>Confused Carla is a college student who enjoys sleeping in a cold

            representative of the users
            who are confused by the interface. She is confused by the difference
            between the heating and cooling system because the interface allows
            her to lower and raise the temperature on both system settings. She
            has trouble recognizing whether or not the system has started heating
            or cooling by looking at the system, so she has to listen for the
            sound of the system kicking on instead. She also has no idea what the
            fan setting is referring to.
          </p>
          <p> <span class="bold_large">What interface problems does Carla face?</span>
            <ul>
              <li>Lack of indication of system starting to heat or cool</li>
              <li>Ability to raise the temperature on the cooling system and lower it on the heating system.</li>
              <li>Seemingly arbitrary fan option</li>

            Steve is representative of users who do not pay much attention when
            they use the thermostat's interface. He is too tired to care because
            he just wants to get back to bed. All he does is push buttons until

              <li>Steve is tired and cannot easily identify if the system is starting
